# Orange Middleware is a bit more complex than Rack middleware. 
# Initializing it requires both a link to the downstream app and 
# the core, and calling the app often requires an Orange::Packet
#
# Orange::Middleware::Base takes care of these basic tasks.
# Subclasses override the init method for extra initialization
# and the packet_call for a call with a packet, rather than
# a basic call
module Orange::Middleware
  class Base
    # Initialize will set the core and downstream app, then call init
    # subclasses should override init instead of initialize.
    # If the subclass defines a stack_init, then it will be registered
    # as a stack_loaded event.
    # @param [Object] app a downstream app 
    # @param [Orange::Core] core the orange core
    # @param [optional, Array] args any arguments
    def initialize(app, core, *args)

    # The standard Rack "call". By default, Orange Middleware wraps the env into
    # an Orange::Packet and passes it on to #packet_call. Subclasses will typically
    # override packet_call rather than overriding call directly. 
    # 
    # Orange Middleware
    # should expect to have this method ignored by upstream Orange-aware apps in
    # favor of calling packet_call directly.

    # @return [Array] the standard Rack striplet of status, headers and content

    # This is called automatically as part of #call, so subclasses can have a packet
    # without having to initialize it. It will be called directly by Orange-aware
    # upstream middleware, skipping the step of initializing the packet during #call.
    # 
    # Passing the packet downstream should be done with #pass rather than the Rack
    # standard @app.call, since #pass will take the packet and do a #packet_call
    # if possible.

    # Pass will sent the packet to the downstream app by calling call or packet call.
    # Calling pass on a packet is the preferred way to call downstream apps, as it
    # will call packet_call directly if possible (to avoid reinitializing the packet)
